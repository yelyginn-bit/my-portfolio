# Codex work log

## 2026-10-02 — CODEX-YE-01

- Added the static, indexable dark `/sajty` page with prerendered SEO metadata,
  FAQPage JSON-LD, the lazy Kinescope video, and Telegram-only CTA.
- Added the four confirmed site prices to `pricing.data.ts`; kept them out of
  `/ceny` and the calculator. Added the landing link only to the services column
  in the footer and listed the landing in sitemap and llms.txt.
- `npm run check` passed after implementation. Browser audits: 0 contrast
  failures, 0 broken words, 0 text geometry failures across indexed routes.
- Captured 390/1440 full-page frames in `.review-shots/codex-ye-01/`; ran the
  before/after visual comparison for all shared indexed routes. The mobile
  canvas grew where the footer now wraps the extra link.
- No writes to `Documents/New_claude/site/`; no server, form endpoint, deploy,
  or push changes.
- Details: [`CODEX-YE-01-report.md`](./CODEX-YE-01-report.md).
- Implementation commit: `c362326`.
